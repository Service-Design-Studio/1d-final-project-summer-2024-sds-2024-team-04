MS-00002633,20240619-0001559,Growing my savings,Matthew,,,Your understanding is correct. Interest will continue to accrue until a full refund for the amount is made.

The interest is computed on the CPF principal amount withdrawn for housing on a monthly basis (at the current CPF Ordinary Account interest rate) and compounded yearly.,,-,"19/06/2024, 12:43 pm"

This amount will be transferred to your Retirement Account (RA). Any excess amount can be withdrawn from your Ordinary Account (OA).\n\nYou have the option to set aside your FRS using a combination of property (up to half the FRS) and cash. Additionally, you can withdraw your Retirement Account (RA) savings down to your Basic Retirement Sum (BRS*), which is $102,900, without pledging your property, provided that your expected housing refund is sufficient to restore your Full Retirement Sum (FRS). You can refer to this link for more information: cpf.gov.sg/member/faq/retirement-income/retirement-withdrawals/remaining-lease-ninety-five-withdraw-ra-savings-using-property. \n\nTo make a withdrawal, you will need to wait until your 55th birthday. Once eligible, you can log in to the CPF website, navigate to the Retirement dashboard, and select Withdraw for immediate needs. Payment will be via Paynow or Interbank Giro.",,,"05/01/2024, 9:54 am"

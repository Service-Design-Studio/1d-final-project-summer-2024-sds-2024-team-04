# Service Design Studio Final Project | Team 04 üöÄ

## Project Overview üìñ
### CPF Text Us Humanless Audit
In this project, our Aim is to grade team members who manage the conversations on the CPF Text-Us Whatsapp platform, on a set of criterias using GenAI instead of having Senior Officers to grade the Officers.

### Problem Statement
How can we make the process of auditing chat transcripts less time consuming and unbiased whilst ensuring its results are consistently within the bandwidth of the audits made by a senior officer.

## Software Architecture üèóÔ∏è

### RESTful API

The application exposes a RESTful API to interact with the system. Below are some of the main API endpoints:

- `GET /api/v1/users` - Retrieve a list of users
- `POST /api/v1/cases` - Create a new case
- `GET /api/v1/chat_transcripts` - Retrieve chat transcripts
- `POST /api/v1/ai_audited_scores` - Submit AI-audited scores

### Database Design
The application uses a relational database to store data. The database schema is defined in the `db/schema.rb` file, and migrations are used to manage changes to the database structure.

#### Key Tables:
- `user` - Stores user information
- `case` - Stores case details
- `chat_transcript` - Stores chat transcripts
- `ai_audited_score` - Stores AI-audited scores
- `human_audited_score` - Stores Human-audited scores
- `audit_criteria` - Stores Grading Criterias
